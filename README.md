# nature-of-code-final-project
# Underground

This project is the first step of an exploration about some narrative possibilities in digital animation. In the future I would like to create small interactive stories for kids that incorporates elements of randomness and generative development in the narrative.

For this final project I decided to create a landscape that allows me to start creating stories.

Inspiration

This draw is a static/hand made inspiration of what I would like to create in digital media with movements and interactions.

I get inspired also from sketches that I found in open processing and in the book Nature of Code of Daniel Shiffman.
